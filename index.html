                    I grew up in Seattle and moved to Chicago in 2007 for college. I'm still a little in denial about living in the (flat, cold in the winter, Satan's damp armpit in the summer) Midwest, but I'm still here eleven years later, so I guess I'm a Chicagoan now. I've even registered to vote here and am excited to actually go to a polling place for once!

                    In addition to coding and caring a whole lot about automation and never hardcoding anything because hardcoding can and will break your entire process irreperably when given half a chance, I run (slowly), knit (less slowly), play video games (poorly), draw (even MORE poorly), and play and run tabletop games. Perhaps unsurprisingly, all of these wrist-heavy hobbies + majoring in violin in college means my wrists are barely hanging on and will probably pop out of my body and escape at some point.

                    My current living situation is sharing a 1br apartment with my sweet dumb roommate, Sgt. Nubbins McBeef (pictured here; he's more photogenic than I am and knows how to work his angles). He is very very sweet and forgiving of all sorts of sins on my part, both real and imagined; the most annoying thing he does is whine if I eat dinner alone instead of sitting on the floor next to his bowl so we can eat together like a family. He is a dumb baby coward most of the time and I give him a hard time about being a chunky fella, but he is a frighteningly efficient murderer and will destroy every rodent that enters our abode. Unfortunately for me and my arachnophobia, he's afraid of spiders and makes me deal with them.
